Digital Marketing Analytics: Data-Driven Growth Strategies

This project analyzes digital marketing performance using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to track traffic, engagement, and conversion rates for an e-commerce store. By examining organic search, paid ads, social media, and email marketing, I identified key trends that drive sales and user engagement. The insights led to strategic recommendations for conversion optimization, personalized marketing, and audience segmentation to boost revenue.
